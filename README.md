# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis


## Overview

## Results:  

 *use bullet and images to support the following answers :*

Data prepocessing:  
- what variables are considered as target
- what variables are considered as features
- what variables are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input

compiling, Training, and Evaluation
- how many neurons, layers and activation functions used, and why
- how the target model performance? accuracy and etc
- what steps had been tried to increase model performance?  


## Summary  

 *summarize overall results of the deep learning model.  
 recommend a different model for this problem, and explain why*
